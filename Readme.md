**Understanding Neural Networks and Backpropagation through a Simple Implementation**
This repository focuses on understanding the mathematics and code behind neural networks and backpropagation by building a simple neural network from scratch. This project is inspired by the tutorial series and example codes provided by Andrej Karpathy on his YouTube channel.

Note: This code and tutorial closely follow the examples provided by [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/@AndrejKarpathy), leveraging his intuitive explanations and hands-on approach to neural networks.
